# Running Forecast Scorecard

Lower is better for RPS, home/draw/away log loss, and Brier score.
Market differences are `market - ours`, so negative means market scored better
on the paired subset and positive means our ledger forecasts scored better.

## Ledger Coverage

- Ledger predictions: 167
- Scored predictions: 162
- Pending predictions: 5

## Our Running Metrics

Bootstrap 95% CIs are reported once the metric has at least 30 finite observations.

## Caveats

- Early in the tournament, resolved ledger forecasts may be zero or too few to support CIs.
- Market comparison only uses matches with both a resolved ledger forecast and market probabilities.
- Polymarket live snapshots are optional and are not assumed to join completed matches here.
